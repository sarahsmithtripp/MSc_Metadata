  abstract = {Winter habitat for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) is a critical concern throughout interior British Columbia, Canada. In winter, mule deer require a food source of twigs and woody browse and face significant winter snow cover. A range of studies have established that good winter range for mule deer reduces the impact of a negative energy balance by providing adequate food, good vegetative cover, and shallow snow. Generally, sites with old Douglas-fir and moderate to high canopy cover on warmer aspects and moderately steep slopes are preferred, resulting in a suite of structural stand conditions, which can be used to map mule deer winter range habitat within the interior Douglas-fir range. The increased availability of light detection and ranging (lidar) data to management agencies and the recent adoption of lidar technology by forestry agencies allow us to assess the capacity of this technology to map some variables important to winter mule deer habitat suitability, using criteria similar to those defined using conventional aerial photography. Results indicate that lidar-derived solar radiation regime, elevation, and overstorey cover are all useful attributes in decision-tree models relating lidar to conventionally derived descriptors of mule deer winter habitat. These lidar-derived models describe up to 75\% of the variance in overall stand structure and confirm that this technology is a viable tool which can be used to assess habitat throughout this region.},

  abstract = {Stand-replacing fires burned at 100 to 300-year intervals for millennia in subalpine conifer forests of western North America, but forests are burning more frequently as climate warms. Postfire tree regeneration is reduced when young forests reburn before recovering from previous fires or when drought occurs during postfire years. However, whether seedling vulnerabilities to harsh microclimate conditions may be amplified in short-interval ({$<$}30~years) fires is unclear. We conducted a field experiment to answer three questions: (1) How do germination, survival, and establishment of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) vary by aspect following high-severity, short-interval fires? (2) What environmental factors control germination, survival, and establishment of both species? (3) Based on our experimental evidence, what proportion of available seed would be expected to establish across landscapes that burned in these short-interval fires? One year postfire, we planted seeds of both species in north-facing, south-facing and flat plots at four sites across the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Wyoming, USA). Soil microclimate was monitored continuously. Seed germination and seedling survival were measured every two weeks during the following growing season and at the beginning and end of the second growing season. Germination did not vary with aspect but increased with early-season soil moisture and temperature. Survival and establishment were low on south-facing aspects ({$<$}1\% of seeds established for both species) and declined with warmer soil temperatures and drier soils. For lodgepole pine, we predicted establishment rates of {$<$}1\% of available seed over 25\% of the reburned landscape. Soil temperatures in short-interval fires were 2\r{}C warmer than similar areas of long-interval fire, with maximum temperatures frequently exceeding 40~\textdegree C. Topographic variation will mediate the consequences of short-interval fire for seedling establishment, leading to patchier tree regeneration as climate warming raises the likelihood of short-interval fires.},

  abstract = {Topography is a key driver of tropical forest structure and composition, as it constrains local nutrient and hydraulic conditions within which trees grow. Yet, we do not fully understand how changes in forest physiognomy driven by topography impact other emergent properties of forests, such as their aboveground carbon density (ACD). Working in Borneo \textendash{} at a site where 70-m-tall forests in alluvial valleys rapidly transition to stunted heath forests on nutrient-depleted dip slopes \textendash{} we combined field data with airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral imaging to characterise how topography shapes the vertical structure, wood density, diversity and ACD of nearly 15 km2 of old-growth forest. We found that subtle differences in elevation \textendash{} which control soil chemistry and hydrology \textendash{} profoundly influenced the structure, composition and diversity of the canopy. Capturing these processes was critical to explaining landscape-scale heterogeneity in ACD, highlighting how emerging remote sensing technologies can provide new insights into long-standing ecological questions.},

  abstract = {Climate measurements are needed at a scale at which organisms live and die. Currently available climate sensors, however, are not well suited for long-term field measurements at such a scale. We have therefore developed a new temperature and moisture logger, the Temperature-Moisture-Sensor (TMS), which we designed for a wide range of ecological applications. The device mimics a small herbaceous plant. Its belowground part houses a patented, proprietary soil moisture sensor working on the time-domain transmission principle. Air, surface and soil temperatures are measured simultaneously by three independent sensors. The TMS data logger has a large memory and long battery life, so it is suitable for taking long-term microclimate measurements in the field. With a data acquisition interval of 15\,min, it has sufficient memory to last for almost 15 years. We have thoroughly tested the TMS logger both in the laboratory and in demanding field conditions ranging from tropical rain forests of Africa to high-elevation cold deserts of the Himalayas. The device has provided microclimate measurements in a wide range of environmental conditions and has also performed well in controlled laboratory settings. The key added value of the TMS logger is that it concurrently measures soil moisture as well as soil, surface and air temperature at a biologically relevant scale. It is also able to continuously measure the microclimate for several years even in the most extreme conditions. The device can therefore be used to build extensive tailored field measurement networks providing crucial data about microclimate conditions shaping biological processes in the face of climate change.},
