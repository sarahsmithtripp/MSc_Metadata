## Raw Microclimate-Data

Raw microclimate data was processed using a combination of rolling means and field notes. If the logger was dislodged, the day it was dislodged could be determined from large increases in microclimate variables. If the logger lost a sunshield, we removed all near-surface measurements prior to revisiting the logger. Full details in parsing process are covered in the R file "Microclimate_logger_parsing." 


## Processed Microclimate-Data

Processed Microclimate data has had soil moisture counts converted based on classifed soil types. Soil type classifcation is discussed in {#Field-Site Data}. Files of soil type are also included in \@ref(fielddat).
